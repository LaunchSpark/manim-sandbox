# Perlin Vector Field Notebook Instructions

- Keep explanations tied to how noise parameters influence the vector field; reference the Manim vector field and noise docs when describing changes.
- Organize cells in the order of imports/setup, field construction, animation helpers, and renders to keep the narrative easy to follow.
- Remove transient execution outputs before committing unless a single frame meaningfully illustrates a key configuration.
