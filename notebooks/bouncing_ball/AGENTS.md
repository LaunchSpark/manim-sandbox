# Bouncing Ball Notebook Instructions

- Keep the notebook focused on the introductory bouncing ball scene; document any parameter changes (e.g., gravity, restitution) with brief Markdown notes that link to the relevant Manim docs.
- Maintain the cell flow of setup/imports, scene construction, and rendering calls so the walkthrough stays linear.
- Clear non-essential outputs before committing; include at most one representative frame if it helps illustrate the motion.
